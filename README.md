# PDB Structure Cleaning and Preprocessing Script

This Python script provides a simple automated approach for cleaning and preprocessing PDB files using Biopython. It allows users to remove water molecules, specific heteroatoms, and non-standard residues, ensuring that the resulting structures are clean and standardized for downstream computational analyses like molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, docking, or structural analysis.

## Features

- **Remove Water Molecules**: Option to remove all water molecules (`HOH, WAT`) from the PDB structure.
- **Selective Heteroatom Removal**: Remove specified heteroatoms (e.g., `PO4`, `SO4`) by providing their residue names.
- **Keep Only Protein Residues**: Retains only standard amino acids and common protonation variants, removing all non-protein residues.
- **Flexible Usage**: Users can apply different cleaning operations based on their specific requirements.

Hereâ€™s a refined version with improved wording and clarity:

## Using Docker: How to Use the Docker Image

### Build the Docker Image
Clone this repository and navigate to the directory containing the `Dockerfile`. Build the Docker image with the following command:
```bash
docker build -t pdb_cleaner .
```

### Run the Docker Container
Navigate to the directory containing your input PDB files. Use the following command to run the script:
```bash
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd):/data" -t pdb_cleaner -i /data/input.pdb -o /data/output.pdb
```

- Replace `input.pdb` and `output.pdb` with the names of your input and output PDB files, respectively.
- The `--rm` flag ensures the container is removed after execution.
- The `-v "$(pwd):/data"` mounts the current directory to `/data` inside the container.

## Using Python: How to Use the Script

### Requirements
- Python 3.6 or newer
- [Biopython](https://biopython.org/)

### Installing Biopython
Install Biopython using one of the following methods:

- Using `pip`:
  ```bash
  pip install biopython
  ```

- Using `conda`:
  ```bash
  conda install -c conda-forge biopython
  ```

### Running the Script
Run the script directly with Python:
```bash
python pdb_processor.py -i <input_pdb_file> -o <output_pdb_file> [options]
```

- Replace `<input_pdb_file>` and `<output_pdb_file>` with the names of your input and output PDB files, respectively.

### Command-line Arguments

| Argument                  | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `-i, --input`             | Path to the input PDB file (required).                       |
| `-o, --output`            | Path to save the cleaned PDB file (required).                |
| `-r, --hetatm`            | List of heteroatoms to remove (e.g., `PO4`, `SO4`).          |
| `-p, --keep-protein-only` | Remove all non-protein residues, keeping only protein residues (cannot be used with `--hetatm`). |
| `-w, --remove-water`      | Remove all water molecules from the structure.               |

### Example Usages

1. **Remove water and keep only protein residues**:

   ```
   python pdb_processor.py -i input.pdb -o output_cleaned.pdb -p
   ```

2. **Remove specific heteroatoms (e.g., PO4) and water molecules**:

   ```
   python pdb_processor.py -i input.pdb -o output_no_hetatm.pdb -r PO4 -w
   ```

3. **Error Example**: The following command will raise an error because `--hetatm` and `--keep-protein-only` are incompatible:

   ```
   python pdb_processor.py -i input.pdb -o output_error.pdb -r PO4 -p
   ```

**Error Handling**: Ensures incompatible options are not used together (e.g., `--hetatm` and `--keep-protein-only`).
